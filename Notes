SQL Database

The database was created on SQL using the imdb_5000_movies.csv and imdb_5000_credits.csv. The movies csv had to be cleaned on jupyter notebook due to an error in SQL (Wasn't accepting the file). 
After clean the file could be submitted.

The diagram was created using https://app.quickdatabasediagrams.com website, with a main table 'Movies' and three ohter tables, cast, crew and keywords.
